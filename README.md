# Balancing_ROBOT

## Balancing Rotary Inverted Pendulum

### Construction of Robot

The robot is made of three parts - base, arm, pendulum.

They were modelled in solidworks, converted to urdf using plugin. The urdf is used by ROS to control robot and by  gazebo to simulate the robot.

### Controllers used in ROS

- Joint State Publisher - To get the current state of robot joints from gazebo. Here joint1 and joint2. It is available in ros.
- Joint Effort Controller - To control the torque applied to the particular joint. Here the torque is used to control joint1. Joint2 is a passive joint. It is available in ros.
- Balancing algorithm - To balance the pendulum in an upright position we have written a python program which commands the Joint Effort Controller how to change by reading joint values from Joint State Publisher.

### Balancing Algorithm

Here we use the Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) to achieve stability around the unstable equilibrium point(i.e., upright position). Since this algorithm is valid for a small range of values of angle for pendulum, we implement a pid controller for values outside this range(or for higher values of deviations in pendulumâ€™s upright position). PID controller alone would not be able to stabilize the system, as it is very difficult to tune the pid values. PID results in a drift, which after some time accumulates and makes the system unstable. 

### Video

This video demostrates the working of the robot when a small disturbance is given to the arm.
